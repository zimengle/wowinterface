		If you're having a problem getting your controller to work or setting up, please refer to the <a href="page:Controller">|cff69ccf0controller section|r</a> for articles on how to configure your controller. While ConsolePort can work with any controller, getting an input mapper to work properly with your specific device might require a few extra steps.
