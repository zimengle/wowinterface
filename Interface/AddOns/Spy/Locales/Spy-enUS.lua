|cffffd000Nearby list|cffffffff
The Nearby list displays any enemy players that have been detected nearby. Clicking the list allows you to target the player, however this only works out of combat. Players are removed from the list if they have not been detected after a period of time.

The clear button in the title bar can be used to clear the list, and holding Control while clearing the list will allow you to quickly enable/disable Spy.

|cffffd000Last Hour list|cffffffff
The Last Hour list displays all enemies that have been detected in the last hour.

|cffffd000Ignore list|cffffffff
Players that are added to the Ignore list will not be reported by Spy. You can add and remove players to/from this list by using the button's drop down menu or by holding the Control key while clicking the button.

|cffffd000Kill On Sight list|cffffffff
Players on your Kill On Sight list cause an alarm to sound when detected. You can add and remove players to/from this list by using the button's drop down menu or by holding the Shift key while clicking the button.

The drop down menu can also be used to set the reasons why you have added someone to the Kill On Sight list. If you want to enter a specific reason that is not in the list, then use the "Enter your own reason..." in the Other list.
