* On going testing for which spells reset the melee swing timer
	- Assuming all spells for the following classes (Mage, Priest, Warlock)
	- Assuming no spells for the following until further tested (Shaman, Paladin, Rogue)
	- Assuming no spells other than known spells for the following (Warrior, Druid, Hunter)
* Veritcal bar options
* More border, bar, and text texture options
* Add the hunter "Heartbeat" which happens every 0.5s (need to figure out when it starts) and only happens when clipping an auto

BUGS
* Hunter bar takes roughly 3 seconds to load when the interface is reloaded
* Speed buffs should only affect the next swing
* Something is preventing people from many interface actions, mostly clickin on items in windows
* Dragging and dropping to any point other than CENTER causes the offsets in the settings to be off
	I need to make a utility that converts other points to CENTER

THINGS ACE3 WOULD MAKE EASIER
* Profiles would also be nice
* Add something so the addon adds a button that attaches to the minimap
